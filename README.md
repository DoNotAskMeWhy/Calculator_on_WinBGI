# Calculator_on_WinBGI
A calculator that transforms an arithmetical question (string) into the numerical equivalent and it's result made with the graphical library WinBGI in Visual Studio.

This project was made in colaboration with Nicu Capatina, as a final assignment for the programing class. I did the graphical part (Graphics.cpp) and my peer did the logical part (Logic.cpp), with some modification made by me for project integration.

You can watch the project in work on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qVtAz_czTwY)


### Notes:
- The music file was replaced with a compresed version, because of GitHub file size limit.
- There is a file that I remmoved (bgi.sdf), because of, again, GitHub file size limit, but that didn't influence anything in the project on the first sight.
- To compile the project yourself, you need to open **bgi.sln** and press F5, and if you want to see the code itself, just open through the VS explorer **Graphics.cpp**, **Logic.cpp** and **Functions.h** (the rest of the files were included with the WinBGI library).
