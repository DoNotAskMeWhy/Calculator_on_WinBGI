# Calculator_on_WinBGI
A calculator with an UI that transforms an arithmetical question (string) into the numerical equivalent and it's result, made with the graphical library WinBGI in Visual Studio.

This project was made in colaboration with **Nicu Capatina**, as the final assignment for the programing class (December 2019). I did the graphical part and my peer did the logical part, with some modification made by me for project integration.

You can watch the project in work on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qVtAz_czTwY)


### Notes:
- The original music file was replaced with a compressed version, because of GitHub file size limit.
- There is a file that I removed (bgi.sdf), because of, again, GitHub file size limit, but that didn't influence anything in the project itself *on the first sight*.
- To compile the project yourself, you need to open **bgi.sln** and press F5 (assuming you have VS *2019* installed). And if you want to see the code itself, just open through the VS explorer **Graphics.cpp**, **Logic.cpp** and **Functions.h** (the rest of the files in the VS project were included with the WinBGI library).
